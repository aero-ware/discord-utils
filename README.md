# discord-utils

this is a small package full of discord.js utilities.

there are methods for formatting, getting input, and pagination.

here is a small example of it in action:

es6 import/export
```js
import { aDelayOf } from "@aeroware/discord-utils";

...
await aDelayOf(1000); // wait one second
...
```

nodejs require
```js
const { aDelayOf } = require("@aeroware/discord-utils").default;

...
await aDelayOf(1000); // wait one second
...
```

you can read the docs on [our github page](https://aero-ware.github.io/aeroclient/#utils)
