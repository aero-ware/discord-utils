# discord-utils

this is a small package full of discord.js utilities.

there are methods for formatting, getting input, and pagination.

here is a small example of it in action:

```js
import { aDelayOf } from "@aeroware/discord-utils";

...
await aDelayOf(1000); // wait one second
...
```

you can read the docs on [our github page](aero-ware.github.io)
